# feral<br/>pure internet

Built using [Hono](https://hono.dev/), [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/), and a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

This site is solar powered, and is only available when the sun is shining. It currently uses an Esprit Paradise panel, which barely provides enough power. It is supplemented by a small battery pack.

This is an [open source](https://github.com/iammatthias/feral-pure-internet) work in progress.
