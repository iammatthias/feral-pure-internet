#Pure Internet

## Feral

### What is this?

This is an exploration of "pure internet". It is built with Hono and Caddy, and serves a single static page of HTML from a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Soon, it will be solar powered, and the site will be available only when the sun is shining.

Pure internet that encourages you to reconsider your relationship with "online" and hosting providers.
