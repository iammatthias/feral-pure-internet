# feral<br/>pure internet

Built using [Hono](https://hono.dev/), [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/), and a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

The Raspberry Pi is powered by an Esprit Paradise solar panel (for now), which barely provides enough power and is supplemented by a small battery pack. Ideally the final form will be portable.

This is an [open source](https://github.com/iammatthias/feral-pure-internet) work in progress.
