Built using [Hono](https://hono.dev/), [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/), and a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Eventually it will be solar powered, and the site will be available only when the sun is shining.

This is an [open source](https://github.com/iammatthias/feral-pure-internet) work in progress.
