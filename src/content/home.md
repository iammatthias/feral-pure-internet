# pure internet

This is an exploration of "pure internet".

It is built using [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) to serve a single page of HTML from a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Soon, it will be solar powered, and the site will be available only when the sun is shining.

This is [open source](https://github.com/iammatthias/feral-pure-internet), and a work in progress.
